## Arithmetic Expression Compiler
This is an arithmetic expression compiler written in Java. It is designed to compile arithmetic expressions involving addition and subtraction into x86 assembly code. The generated assembly code is saved in a file and can be compiled further using an assembly language compiler.

## Features
* Compiles arithmetic expressions with addition and subtraction operators.
* Generates x32-bit assembly code as output.
* Provides a flexible and extensible platform for handling mathematical expressions.

## Usage
* Write your arithmetic expression in the input file.
* Run the compiler program in Java.
* The compiler will generate assembly code and save it in an output file.
* Compile the generated assembly code using an assembler to produce executable machine code.

## Compatibility
This compiler is compatible with Java and x32-bit assembly language. It can be used on various platforms that support these technologies.
